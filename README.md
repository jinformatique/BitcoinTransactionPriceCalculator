# Bitcoin Transaction Price Calculator

Bitcoin Transaction Price Calculator is a web application that allows you to look up any Bitcoin transaction and instantly discover the price of Bitcoin in your preferred currency at the exact time the transaction was confirmed. You can paste up to 5 transaction IDs, to see the price difference between the transaction time and now.

## üì∞ Story

This project started as a vibe coding experiment because of the frustration to find nothing close online apart from the transaction-calculator on bitcoinaverage, but their website was down.

## üåü Features

- **Transaction Lookup:** Enter any valid Bitcoin transaction ID (TxID) to fetch its details.
- **Historical Price Calculation:** See the price of Bitcoin at the time the transaction was confirmed, not just the current price.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Choose from 30+ world currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, INR, ZAR, and more) for price conversion.
- **Detailed Transaction Outputs:** View all transaction outputs, their value in BTC, and their equivalent fiat value at the transaction time.
- **Total Output Calculation:** Instantly see the total output value in both BTC and your selected currency.
- **Transaction Details:** Get confirmation status, transaction fee, and timestamp in a human-readable format.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **API Powered:** Uses [Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) for transaction data and [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com/) for historical price data.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Enter a Bitcoin Transaction ID:**
